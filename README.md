<h2> Have You Tried An AI Powered Hacking Environment ??? </h2>
<h3> Introducing Digle: </h3>

<h4>Easy To Use, PowerFul, Colorful, Fast, Intelligent, Hacking Environment, `Console Application`</h4>

Digle, Or Digital Eagle, A Massive Command Line Based Environment Aimed At Hacking.

If Your a Skilled Social Engineer, Then Digle is for you, Why?
<h2>Because</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Because, Digle Support Building Intelligent Malwares, Different File Types, With User-Specified Power And Properties of the malware</li>
 <li>Because, Digle Support Building Keyloggers, Intelligent And HollyWood-Like Data Receiver And Displayer</li>
 <li>Because, Digle's Malwares Are Made To Hold Himselfs Intelligently...</li>
 <li>Because, Digle Is HollyWood Like...</li>
 <li>Because, It's Dedicated For You.....</li>
</ul>



<h2>Digle's Tool Power</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Digle Can Spawn Malwares, With a user-specified type, Like saying to digle to spawn a windows executable that log keystrokes, Or Open a Reverse Shell, Or saying to spawn a Dropper that Inject some System Files, and much more with Different File Types</h4>
  </li>
  <li> Digle Provide Phishing Tools, Phishing Web Camera, Or Social Media's Accounts</li>
  <li> Digle Provide Scripting Engine, Enabling Shell Programmers to create windows in terminal, move cursor from one location to another one easilly, and much more, By Increasing Shell Scripting Power To The Maximum</li>
  <li> Digle Malwares, From Basic Reverse Shells into Super Interactive Remote Controlled Malware, Named Digle Super Malware Or DSM</li>
  <li> Digle's Super Malwares are intelligent, they hide Themselves, They Detect Virtual Machines Or Debugging, They can inject themselves in a Running Process, They can Destroy Device if user tried to delete The Malware.</li>
  <li> Digle Can inject Files with Each Others, Helping User to inject a pre-spawned malware in a specified file or script, Injection Supports Many Extensions</li>
  <li> Digle Provide an Exellent Terminal-Based Chatting App (2 Members Only For Every Chatting Room).</li>
  <li> Digle Provide Some Text-Based Games, 2D and 3D For Fun Only</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tools And Properties That Currently Working On To Add</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A Linux Automated Keylogger That Finds The Keyboard Event File Automatically And Sends Keystrokes in an Encrypted Form Back to Attacker Over TCP.</li>
  <li> A File Injection Utility That Support Injecting Scripts in Each Others to run together such as injecting Binaries to run with Interpreted Languages Such as Python, Bash...</li>
  <li> A Process Injection Utility</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future's Updates if People Liked Digle</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Binary File Code Injection (Especially For ELF)</li>
  <li> A GUI Based Automated Environment For Digle Shell (Qt)</li>
  <li> More Scripting Power</li>
  <li> Advanced Fileless Malwares</li>
  <li> Some Wireless Tools For Wireless Networks</li>
</ol> 

<h2>Usage: </h2>

<ol>
  <li>Execute bash zstart.sh and wait the installation</li>
  <li>Execute help to show all commands with their short description</li> 
  <li>Execute info followed by a command name to learn its usage</li>
  <li>Enjoy Hacking</li>
</ol>
